    <br>
    <p>Tandoori chicken is a flavorful Indian dish of chicken marinated
        in a spiced yogurt sauce and traditionally roasted in a tandoor,
        a cylindrical clay oven. At home, it can be cooked in a conventional oven,
         on a grill, or even on a stovetop, and is known for its smoky aroma and 
         tender, juicy texture. The deep red-orange color typically comes from 
         Kashmiri red chili powder or food coloring. </p>
    <p>This universally popular dish is characterized by several key features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Smoky flavor</b>: The high cooking temperature creates a distinctive smoky and charred flavor. For home cooks, this can be replicated by broiling in an oven, grilling, or using a charcoal smoking method (Dhungar).</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><b>Complex spices</b>: The signature flavor comes from a blend of spices, including ginger, garlic, garam masala, cumin, coriander, and kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).</p>
        </li>
        <li>    <p><b>Juicy and tender meat</b>: A thick yogurt marinade helps tenderize the chicken, keeping it moist throughout the high-heat cooking process.</p>
        </h3>

    <h3>Tandoori chicken recipe (oven method)</h3>
    <p>This recipe uses a simple two-stage marination process for maximum flavor and tenderness.    

    </p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul><li>1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) chicken drumsticks or thighs, skin removed</li>
    <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt </li>
    <li>1 cup thick plain yogurt (or Greek yogurt)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li></ul>

    <br>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the chicken</b>. Clean the chicken pieces thoroughly and pat them completely dry with paper towels. Make several deep cuts or slits in the meat to allow the marinade to penetrate.</li>
        <li><b>Apply the first marinade</b>. In a bowl, rub the chicken pieces with lemon juice and salt. Let it rest for at least 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Make the second marinade</b>. In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, oil, and all the spices (chili powder, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, kasuri methi, black pepper, and salt) until it forms a thick, smooth paste. Add food coloring now if you are using it.</li>
        <li><b>Marinate the chicken</b>. Drain any excess liquid from the first marinade. Add the chicken pieces to the yogurt marinade and rub it in thoroughly, making sure it gets into all the slits. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4–6 hours, or overnight for the best flavor.
</li>
        <li><b>Preheat the oven</b>. When ready to cook, remove the chicken from the fridge and let it sit for 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking sheet with foil, placing a wire rack on top.       </li>
    </ol>
